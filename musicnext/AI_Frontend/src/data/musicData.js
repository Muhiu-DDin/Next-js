      title: 'Image Dataset for AOD-Net Training',
      description:
          'This dataset is specifically designed for training the AOD-Net model for image dehazing. It consists of two primary folders: "gt/" (Ground Truth), which contains clear, high-quality images, and "hazy/", which includes the corresponding hazy versions of those images. This dataset enables supervised learning for dehazing applications.',
  },
  {
      title: 'Dataset Structure',
      description:
          'Each image in the "hazy/" folder has a corresponding clear image in the "gt/" folder with the exact same filename. This ensures a one-to-one mapping, allowing precise pixel-wise comparison. The dataset is carefully curated to provide a diverse range of haze conditions, making it robust for training deep learning models.',
  },
  {
      title: 'Purpose of the Dataset',
      description:
          'The primary goal of this dataset is to train the AOD-Net model, a deep learning-based approach for single-image dehazing. The model learns to reconstruct a clear image from a hazy input by minimizing the difference between its output and the ground truth images. The dataset also serves as a benchmark for evaluating dehazing algorithms.',
  },
  {
      title: 'Usage in Training',
      description:
          'To use this dataset for training, images from both "gt/" and "hazy/" folders are loaded as input-output pairs. Standard preprocessing techniques, such as image normalization and resizing, are applied. Data augmentation methods like rotation, flipping, and contrast adjustments can further enhance generalization. The AOD-Net model is trained using loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and perceptual loss to improve dehazing performance.',

    title: 'AOD-Net Model Overview',
    description:
        'AOD-Net (All-in-One Dehazing Network) is a deep learning model designed for single-image dehazing. It is based on a compact yet powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The model efficiently removes haze by extracting multi-scale features and computing an optimized dehazed image using learned element-wise operations.',

      title: 'Model Architecture & Functionality',
      description:
          'The AOD-Net model is implemented using PyTorch and consists of five convolutional layers with ReLU activations. Each layer extracts increasingly complex features from the input image. The architecture follows a multi-scale feature extraction strategy, where outputs from different layers are concatenated to improve haze removal. The final dehazed image is computed using a formula that refines feature maps and reconstructs a clean image from hazy input.',

          '1. **Conv1 (1x1 kernel):** Extracts the initial features from the input image.\n' +
          '2. **Conv2 (3x3 kernel):** Enhances feature representation to capture local structures.\n' +
          '3. **Conv3 (5x5 kernel):** Concatenates features from previous layers to capture a wider context.\n' +
          '4. **Conv4 (7x7 kernel):** Further refines features by combining outputs from previous layers.\n' +
          '5. **Conv5 (3x3 kernel):** Final feature extraction layer before computing the clean image.\n' +
          '6. **Final Computation:** The clean image is computed using the formula:\n' +
          '**clean_image = ReLU((x5 * x) - x5 + 1)**, where x5 is the final extracted feature map, and x is the original hazy input.',
